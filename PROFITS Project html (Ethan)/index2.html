    <h2 style="text-align: center;">About My Life and Myself</h2>
	<p style="text-align: center;">I am Ethan Shepherdson and I am a humble Singaporean currently studying in Temasek Polytechnic in my course, Cyber Security. I live in a family of 5, my mother and father, my two young sisters and my grandmother. I also live in the East of Singapore where I grew up in. When I was in my first few months since birth, my familiy moved into a three story landed property. The reason being as to the need to expand our holding capacity of our growing familiy. I am also a fan of Star Wars and a person of interest in learning history of World War 2 (WW2). I am also a person who wants to serve my country as a police officer for my future career. This is because I want my career to have a purpose, which is to protect Singapore from illegal activities and to protect my fellow citizens.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">My Interest and Future Aspirations</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">For me, my interest is to learn new skills and abilities for life problem solving. I am also interested in achieving success and to push myself beyond my limitations so that I can be a better person than before. I also want to have a more healthy and prosperous life style as I want to plan ahead for my future so that my journey throughout my life would have little to no issues from financial to social. I also have a future aspiration of serving my nation with pride and purpose as a police officer. This gave me the thought of having a job that is meaningful and that is important for the protection and security of the nation and its people. I also want to live at a high standard of discipline, competentcy and determination.</p>
